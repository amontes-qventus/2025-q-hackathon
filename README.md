# Case Cancellations and No-Show Prediction (CNSP)

## Description
A predictive model designed to identify patients at high risk of canceling or not showing up for their scheduled surgeries. By analyzing historical data such as patient demographics, case types, and case history, the model generates risk scores. The goal is to provide schedulers with actionable insights to mitigate these risks through timely interventions.

## Impact
This project is both innovative and impactful, addressing a critical inefficiency in perioperative workflowsâ€”unanticipated schedule gaps caused by cancellations or no-shows. Proactively addressing these gaps enables hospitals to:

- **Increase OR utilization rates.**
- **Enhance patient satisfaction** by efficiently rescheduling potentially canceled cases.
- **Reduce revenue loss** from unused OR time.
- Allow perioperative teams to **focus on patient care** rather than managing last-minute scheduling adjustments.
